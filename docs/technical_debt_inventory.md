   - Document decisions in code comments

### Short-term Goals (Next Month)

1. **Reduce Technical Debt by 50%**
   - Weekly debt reduction sprints
   - Focus on medium priority items after high priority items are addressed

2. **Implement Automated Detection**
   - Set up static analysis tools to detect new debt
   - Add CI checks for TODO/FIXME comments

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update documentation to reflect resolved issues
   - Create coding standards to prevent new debt

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Zero-Tolerance Policy for New Debt**
   - Require justification and tracking for any new TODO/FIXME
   - Set expiration dates on all new technical debt items

2. **Regular Debt Review Sessions**
   - Monthly review of technical debt inventory
   - Adjust priorities based on project needs

3. **Refactoring Sprints**
   - Dedicated time for addressing technical debt
   - Focus on architectural improvements
