   - Use RAII for all resources
   - Avoid raw pointers; use smart pointers
   - Check all return values from Vulkan API calls
   - Always clean up resources in reverse order of creation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use exceptions for exceptional conditions only
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Ensure proper cleanup in error paths

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep functions under 50 lines
   - Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document public APIs

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for all new functionality
   - Maintain >80% test coverage
   - Include performance tests for critical paths
   - Test error conditions

### Quality Gates
