# Agent Orchestrator System

## 🎯 Orchestrator-Worker Architecture

### Core Concept
A primary **Orchestrator Agent** coordinates multiple specialized **Worker Agents** through a task management system with clear task definition, assignment, progress tracking, and completion verification.

## 🏗️ System Components

### 1. Orchestrator Agent (Primary)
**Role**: Task planning, coordination, and quality assurance
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze project goals and break them into actionable tasks
- Create detailed task specifications with acceptance criteria
- Assign tasks to appropriate worker agents
- Monitor progress and resolve conflicts
- Perform integration and quality checks
- Update roadmap and documentation

### 2. Worker Agents (Specialized)
**Roles**: Execute specific domain tasks with high expertise
**Types**:
- **VMA Specialist**: Memory management improvements
- **Vulkan Graphics Specialist**: Rendering and compute shaders
- **Architecture Specialist**: System design and refactoring
- **Testing & QA Specialist**: Testing, CI/CD, and quality assurance

### 3. Task Management System
**Components**:
- Task board with status tracking
- Task specification templates
- Progress monitoring
- Conflict resolution system
- Integration checkpoints

## 📋 Task Management Framework

### Task States
```
PLANNED -> ASSIGNED -> IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> COMPLETED -> INTEGRATED
```

### Task Priority Levels
- **P0**: Critical blocker (immediate action required)
- **P1**: High priority (current sprint)
- **P2**: Medium priority (next sprint)
- **P3**: Low priority (backlog)

### Task Categories
- **FEATURE**: New functionality implementation
- **IMPROVEMENT**: Enhancement of existing features
- **BUGFIX**: Bug resolution
- **REFACTOR**: Code quality improvements
- **DOCS**: Documentation updates
- **SETUP**: Environment and tooling
