User requested a custom C++ engine project with:
- Vulkan for graphics (AMD-optimized, cross-platform)
- HIP for GPU compute (AMD/CUDA portability)
- CMake build system
- Minimal Vulkan setup first, then HIP setup
- This summary is a backup of user intent and requirements

Planned steps:
1. C++ project with CMake
2. Vulkan SDK integration
3. Minimal Vulkan example
4. HIP integration and example
5. Document everything
