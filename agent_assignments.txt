## Agent Communication Protocol & Time Management

### Swap File Communication System

#### Core Protocol Structure
All agents communicate through a shared JSON-based swap file system with pseudo-mutex sections. Each agent must follow this protocol strictly:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1.0",
  "system_time": {
    "session_start": "2025-05-30T00:00:00Z",
    "last_update": "2025-05-30T14:30:15Z",

      "locked_by": "agent_1",
      "lock_timestamp": "2025-05-30T14:25:00Z",
      "lock_duration_estimate": 15,
      "queue": ["agent_3", "agent_2"]
    },
    "build_testing": {
      "locked_by": null,

    }
  },

    "agent_1": {
      "status": "active",
      "current_task": "implementing_compute_shaders",
      "progress_percent": 65,
      "estimated_completion": "2025-05-30T15:00:00Z",
      "last_checkin": "2025-05-30T14:30:00Z",
      "blocked_on": [],
      "blocking": ["agent_4"]
    },
    "agent_2": {
      "status": "waiting",
      "current_task": "3d_rule_implementation",
      "progress_percent": 30,
      "estimated_completion": "2025-05-30T16:00:00Z",

    }
  },

    "grid_data_format": {
      "owner": "agent_2",
      "version": "1.2",
      "last_modified": "2025-05-30T13:45:00Z",
      "status": "stable",
      "dependencies": ["agent_1", "agent_3"]
    },

      "owner": "agent_1",

      "type": "build_request",
      "message": "Compute shaders ready for testing. Buffer layout changed - see grid_data_format v1.2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Time Management Framework

#### Time Awareness Protocol
Since agents are generally unaware of time, each agent must implement these time-awareness behaviors:

1. **Session Time Tracking**:
   - Always check `system_time.session_duration_minutes` to understand how long the session has been running
   - Use `system_time.current_phase` to understand project phase (planning/development/testing/maintenance)
   - Update `last_checkin` timestamp every time you access the swap file

2. **Time Estimation Requirements**:
   - Provide realistic `estimated_completion` times for current tasks
   - Update `progress_percent` based on actual work completed
   - Specify `lock_duration_estimate` when requesting mutex locks

3. **Time-Based Decision Making**:
   ```
   IF session_duration_minutes < 60 THEN
     focus_on = "planning_and_setup"
   ELSE IF session_duration_minutes < 240 THEN
     focus_on = "core_implementation"
   ELSE IF session_duration_minutes < 480 THEN
     focus_on = "integration_and_testing"
   ELSE
     focus_on = "polish_and_documentation"
   ```

### Pseudo-Mutex Implementation

#### Mutex Section Types
1. **global_lock**: For system-wide operations (rare use only)
2. **code_modification**: For editing source files
3. **build_testing**: For running builds or tests
4. **documentation**: For updating docs and comments
5. **file_io**: For reading/writing pattern files or configs

#### Lock Acquisition Protocol
```
PROCEDURE acquire_lock(section_name, estimated_duration):
  1. Read current swap file
  2. Check if section is locked:
     IF locked AND (current_time - lock_timestamp) > (lock_duration_estimate + 5_minutes):
       // Assume stale lock, break it
       SET locked_by = null
     END IF
  3. IF section is free:
       SET locked_by = agent_id
       SET lock_timestamp = current_time
       SET lock_duration_estimate = estimated_duration
       WRITE swap file
       RETURN success
     ELSE:
       ADD agent_id to queue if not already present
       WRITE swap file
       RETURN waiting
```

#### Lock Release Protocol
```
PROCEDURE release_lock(section_name):
  1. SET locked_by = null
  2. SET lock_timestamp = null
  3. IF queue is not empty:
       MOVE first agent from queue to locked_by
       SET lock_timestamp = current_time
     END IF
  4. WRITE swap file
```

### Agent-Specific Communication Behaviors

#### Agent 1 (Vulkan Graphics)
- **Lock Requirements**: Primarily needs `code_modification` for shader files
- **Communication Pattern**: Frequent updates to `vulkan_pipeline` artifact status
- **Time Behavior**: Works in 15-30 minute focused sessions on specific shaders
- **Blocking Behavior**: Often blocks Agent 4 until pipeline is testable

#### Agent 2 (Game Logic)
- **Lock Requirements**: Needs `code_modification` for algorithm files, `documentation` for rule specs
- **Communication Pattern**: Updates `grid_data_format` and notifies dependent agents
- **Time Behavior**: Longer 45-60 minute algorithm implementation sessions
- **Blocking Behavior**: Can work independently but affects all other agents when data format changes

#### Agent 3 (Architecture/UI)
- **Lock Requirements**: Needs `code_modification` frequently, occasional `documentation`
- **Communication Pattern**: Coordinates between other agents, manages integration issues
- **Time Behavior**: Reactive - responds to other agents' work, shorter 10-20 minute bursts
- **Blocking Behavior**: Rarely blocks others but often blocked by Agents 1&2

#### Agent 4 (Build/Test)
- **Lock Requirements**: Exclusive use of `build_testing`, occasional `code_modification` for build files
- **Communication Pattern**: Provides build results via message queue to all agents
- **Time Behavior**: Scheduled runs every 30-60 minutes or when triggered
- **Blocking Behavior**: Blocked by ongoing development, blocks release activities

#### Agent 5 (Quality)
- **Lock Requirements**: Read-only access patterns, occasional `documentation`, rare `code_modification`
- **Communication Pattern**: Sends quality reports via message queue
- **Time Behavior**: Long-running analysis sessions (60-120 minutes), scheduled weekly deep scans
- **Blocking Behavior**: Rarely blocks others, works asynchronously

### Communication Examples

#### Example 1: Agent Handoff
```json
// Agent 2 finishing work, notifying Agent 1
{
  "from": "agent_2",
  "to": "agent_1",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T14:30:00Z",
  "priority": "medium",
  "type": "work_ready",
  "message": "3D rule implementation complete. Grid format finalized at v1.2. Ready for compute shader integration."
}
```

#### Example 2: Build Request
```json
// Agent 1 requesting build after major changes
{
  "from": "agent_1",
  "to": "agent_4",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T14:45:00Z",
  "priority": "high",
  "type": "build_request",
  "message": "Vulkan pipeline v0.9 ready. New shaders added. Please run full build with validation layers."
}
```

#### Example 3: Quality Alert
```json
// Agent 5 reporting issues found
{
  "from": "agent_5",
  "to": "all",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T15:00:00Z",
  "priority": "low",
  "type": "quality_report",
  "message": "Found 3 TODO items in vulkan_renderer.cpp. Memory leak potential in buffer cleanup. See detailed report in docs/quality_report_20250530.md"
}
```

### Swap File Management Rules

1. **Atomic Operations**: Always read-modify-write the entire swap file
2. **Backup Strategy**: Keep last 3 versions as .bak files
3. **Corruption Recovery**: If JSON is malformed, restore from .bak and continue
4. **Size Limits**: Keep message queue under 50 items, rotate old messages
5. **Cleanup**: Remove completed messages older than 2 hours

### Enhanced Cross-Agent Collaboration

#### Workflow With Communication Protocol
1. **Development Cycle**: 
   - Agents 1-3 coordinate via mutex locks and message queue
   - Agent 4 monitors for build requests and provides feedback
   - Agent 5 performs background analysis and reports issues

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Use message queue priority levels (high/medium/low)
   - Implement exponential backoff for lock contention
   - Agent 3 acts as coordinator for complex multi-agent tasks

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - All agents update progress_percent for visibility
   - Use estimated_completion for project timeline management
   - Session phase determines agent priorities and focus areas
