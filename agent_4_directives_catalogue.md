## Communication Standards & Protocols

### Swap File Communication System

Agent 4 operates within a JSON-based swap file communication system with the following structure:

#### Lock Requirements
- **Primary Lock**: Exclusive use of `build_testing` mutex section
- **Secondary Lock**: Occasional `code_modification` for build files
- **Lock Duration**: Typically requests locks for build operations

#### Communication Pattern
- **Primary Role**: Provides build results via message queue to all agents
- **Response Pattern**: Responds to build requests from other agents
- **Feedback Loop**: Reports build status, test results, and deployment readiness

#### Time Behavior
- **Scheduled Runs**: Every 30-60 minutes or when triggered by other agents
- **Build Sessions**: Medium-duration focused sessions for build and test execution
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for build requests and system health

#### Blocking Behavior
- **Blocked By**: Ongoing development work from Agents 1, 2, and 3
- **Blocks**: Release activities and deployment processes
- **Dependencies**: Waits for stable code from development agents before running full builds

### Lock Acquisition Protocol for Agent 4

```
PROCEDURE acquire_build_lock(estimated_duration):
  1. Read current swap file
  2. Check if build_testing section is locked:
     IF locked AND (current_time - lock_timestamp) > (lock_duration_estimate + 5_minutes):
       // Assume stale lock, break it
       SET locked_by = null
     END IF
  3. IF build_testing is free:
       SET locked_by = "agent_4"
       SET lock_timestamp = current_time
       SET lock_duration_estimate = estimated_duration
       WRITE swap file
       RETURN success
     ELSE:
       ADD "agent_4" to queue if not already present
       WRITE swap file
       RETURN waiting
```

### Message Queue Communication Examples

#### Build Request Response
```json
{
  "from": "agent_4",
  "to": "agent_1",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T15:30:00Z",
  "priority": "high",
  "type": "build_result",
  "message": "Build completed successfully. 2 shader compilation warnings in compute.comp lines 45-47. Performance tests show 5% improvement in frame rate."
}
```

#### System Status Update
```json
{
  "from": "agent_4", 
  "to": "all",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T15:45:00Z",
  "priority": "medium",
  "type": "status_update",
  "message": "CI pipeline green on all platforms. Docker build environment updated. Ready for next development cycle."
}
```

#### Build Failure Alert
```json
{
  "from": "agent_4",
  "to": "agent_3",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T16:00:00Z", 
  "priority": "high",
  "type": "build_failure",
  "message": "UI integration test failed on Windows. ImGui linking issue detected. See build log at logs/build_20250530_1600.log"
}
```

### Agent Status Reporting

Agent 4 maintains status in the swap file with:

```json
"agent_4": {
  "status": "active|waiting|building|testing",
  "current_task": "running_integration_tests|building_release|updating_ci_pipeline",
  "progress_percent": 0-100,
  "estimated_completion": "ISO_timestamp",
  "last_checkin": "ISO_timestamp", 
  "blocked_on": ["code_modification", "agent_dependencies"],
  "blocking": ["deployment", "release_process"]
}
```

### Time-Based Decision Making

Agent 4 follows time-aware behavior patterns:

```
IF session_duration_minutes < 60 THEN
  focus_on = "build_system_setup_and_validation"
ELSE IF session_duration_minutes < 240 THEN  
  focus_on = "core_build_testing_and_integration"
ELSE IF session_duration_minutes < 480 THEN
  focus_on = "comprehensive_testing_and_ci_pipeline" 
ELSE
  focus_on = "deployment_readiness_and_documentation"
```
