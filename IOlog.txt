## Refactoring Plan: Modular Vulkan Engine (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Goal:** Refactor the monolithic `VulkanEngine` class into a component-based architecture to improve maintainability, testability, and collaboration.

**Overall Strategy:**
- Gradually extract responsibilities from `VulkanEngine` into new, focused manager classes.
- `VulkanEngine` will become a coordinator, owning instances of these managers.
- Update dependencies and call sites as functionality is moved.
- Ensure the application remains functional (or at least buildable) after each major step.
- Update/create unit tests for new/refactored components.

**Phase 1: Core Vulkan Context & Device Management**
*   **Objective:** Isolate Vulkan instance, physical/logical device, and queue management.
1.  **Create `QueueFamilyIndices.h` (if not already separate)**
    *   [ ] Define the `QueueFamilyIndices` struct.
2.  **Create `DeviceManager.h` and `DeviceManager.cpp`**
    *   [ ] Members: `VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice`, `VkDevice device`, `QueueFamilyIndices queueFamilyIndices`, `VkQueue graphicsQueue`, `VkQueue presentQueue`, `VkQueue computeQueue`. (Potentially references to `VulkanContext` or `VkInstance`/`VkSurfaceKHR` for queries).
    *   [ ] Methods:
        *   `DeviceManager(VkInstance instance, VkSurfaceKHR surface)` constructor.
        *   `pickPhysicalDevice()`
        *   `isDeviceSuitable(VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice) const`
        *   `findQueueFamilies(VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice) const`
        *   `checkDeviceExtensionSupport(VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice) const`
        *   `createLogicalDevice(const std::vector<const char*>& validationLayers, const VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures& enabledFeatures, const std::vector<const char*>& deviceExtensions)`
        *   `cleanup()`
        *   Getters for `VkPhysicalDevice`, `VkDevice`, `QueueFamilyIndices`, and queues.
3.  **Create `VulkanContext.h` and `VulkanContext.cpp`**
    *   [ ] Members: `VkInstance vkInstance`, `VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT debugMessenger`, `std::unique_ptr<DeviceManager> deviceManager`.
    *   [ ] Methods:
        *   `VulkanContext(GLFWwindow* window)` (or takes surface directly)
        *   `init(const std::vector<const char*>& validationLayers, const std::vector<const char*>& requiredExtensions)` (Handles instance creation, debug messenger setup, surface creation - surface creation might move to WindowManager later).
        *   `initDeviceManager(const VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures& enabledFeatures, const std::vector<const char*>& deviceExtensions)`
        *   `cleanup()`
        *   Getters for `VkInstance`, `VkDevice` (via `deviceManager`), `VkPhysicalDevice` (via `deviceManager`), queues (via `deviceManager`), `VkSurfaceKHR` (if owned here).
4.  **Refactor `VulkanEngine` to use `VulkanContext`**
    *   [ ] `VulkanEngine` holds `std::unique_ptr<VulkanContext>`.
    *   [ ] Delegate `createInstance`, `setupDebugMessenger`, `pickPhysicalDevice`, `createLogicalDevice` calls to `VulkanContext` and its `DeviceManager`.
    *   [ ] Update `VulkanEngine` methods that use `vkInstance`, `physicalDevice`, `device`, `queues` to get them from `VulkanContext`.
5.  **Update `CMakeLists.txt`** to include new files.
6.  **Test:** Ensure basic initialization still works.

---

**Phase 2: Window and Surface Management**
*   **Objective:** Isolate GLFW window and Vulkan surface management.
1.  **Create `WindowManager.h` and `WindowManager.cpp`**
    *   [ ] Members: `GLFWwindow* window`, `VkSurfaceKHR surface`.
    *   [ ] Methods:
        *   `WindowManager(const char* title, int width, int height)`
        *   `initWindow()`
        *   `createSurface(VkInstance instance)`
        *   `cleanup(VkInstance instance)` (instance passed for surface destruction)
        *   `getWindow() const`
        *   `getSurface() const`
        *   `shouldClose() const`
        *   `pollEvents()`
        *   `setFramebufferResizedCallback(GLFWframebuffersizefun callback)`
        *   `setWindowUserPointer(void* pointer)`
        *   `getFramebufferSize(int* width, int* height)`
        *   Static callback: `framebufferResizeCallback` (or adapt existing).
2.  **Refactor `VulkanContext`** (if it currently handles surface creation)
    *   [ ] Surface creation/cleanup moves to `WindowManager`. `VulkanContext` might take `VkSurfaceKHR` in constructor or via a setter from `WindowManager`.
3.  **Refactor `VulkanEngine` to use `WindowManager`**
    *   [ ] `VulkanEngine` holds `std::unique_ptr<WindowManager>`.
    *   [ ] Delegate windowing and surface calls.
    *   [ ] Update `framebufferResized` logic.
4.  **Update `CMakeLists.txt`**.
5.  **Test:** Window creation, surface creation, and resize events.

**Phase 3: Swapchain Management**

1.  **Create `DescriptorSetManager.h` and `DescriptorSetManager.cpp`** (Might be part of PipelineManager or separate)
    *   [ ] Members: `VkDescriptorSetLayout descriptorSetLayout`, `VkDescriptorPool descriptorPool`, `std::vector<VkDescriptorSet> descriptorSets`.
    *   [ ] Dependencies: `VulkanContext`.

4.  **Update `CMakeLists.txt`**.
5.  **Test:** Pipeline creation for both graphics and compute.

**Phase 6: Command and Synchronization Management**

1.  **Create `CommandManager.h` and `CommandManager.cpp`**
    *   [ ] Members: `VkCommandPool graphicsCommandPool`, `VkCommandPool computeCommandPool`. (Command buffers might be per-frame or per-use, managed where needed or by this manager).

**Phase 7: Resource Management (Buffers, Images, Shaders)**
*   **Objective:** Consolidate creation and management of buffers, images, and shader modules.
1.  **Refine `MemoryPool.h` and `MemoryPool.cpp` (or rename to `ResourceManager`)**
    *   [ ] Current `MemoryPool` from `VulkanEngine.h/.cpp` becomes its own class.
    *   [ ] Add methods for image creation: `createImage()`, `createImageView()`.
    *   [ ] Add methods for shader module management: `loadShaderModule(const std::string& path)`, `destroyShaderModule(VkShaderModule module)`. (Store loaded modules to avoid reloads, or let PipelineManager handle this).
    *   [ ] Manage vertex buffers, uniform buffers, depth/color images.
2.  **Refactor `VulkanEngine` to use the refined `ResourceManager` (or `MemoryPool`).**
3.  **Update `CMakeLists.txt`**.
4.  **Test:** Buffer, image, and shader module lifecycle.

---

**Phase 8: Main Loop and Drawing Logic Review**
*   **Objective:** Ensure `VulkanEngine::run()` and `drawFrame()` correctly coordinate the new manager classes.
1.  [ ] Review `VulkanEngine::run()`: Ensure it correctly calls `WindowManager::pollEvents()` and `drawFrame()`.
2.  [ ] Review `VulkanEngine::drawFrame()`:
    *   [ ] Calls to `SyncManager` for waiting on fences and acquiring semaphores.
    *   [ ] Calls to `SwapchainManager` for acquiring next image.
    *   [ ] Calls to `ResourceManager`/`PipelineManager` for updating uniform buffers.
    *   [ ] Calls to `CommandManager` for command buffer recording.
    *   [ ] Calls to `SyncManager` for queue submission with semaphores/fences.
    *   [ ] Calls to `SwapchainManager` for presentation.
    *   [ ] Handles swapchain recreation logic by coordinating `SwapchainManager`, `RenderPassManager`, `FramebufferManager`, `PipelineManager`.
3.  **Test:** Full application run, including window resizing and an end-to-end rendering/compute cycle.

**General Guidelines During Refactoring:**
-   **Commit frequently:** After each logical step or sub-task, commit changes with a clear message.
-   **Build often:** Compile the code frequently to catch errors early.
-   **Test incrementally:** As components are refactored or created, write/update unit tests.
-   **Address TODOs:** Resolve any TODO comments related to the refactoring.
-   **Documentation:** Update comments and Doxygen documentation for new/modified classes and methods.

This is a large undertaking. I will start with **Phase 1: Core Vulkan Context & Device Management**.
I'll create `QueueFamilyIndices.h` first as it's a simple struct.
